##Introduction

Imagine fleeing your home with just a backpack. Crossing an ocean in a raft, only to find the borders closed
Getting the chance to start over in America. Arriving with sparse possessions, no money, little English, and few prospects.
But welcomed by safety, freedom and the generosity of the American people.
[refugeerestore](http://refugeerestore.herokuapp.com/) is a shop that works to retore the lost homes of refugees in the United States. This was created by [Robbie Jaeger](https://github.com/robbiejaeger), [Kerry Sheldon](https://github.com/kjs222), and [Karina Gonzalez](https://github.com/karinamzalez), as part of the [Turing School of Software & Design's](https://www.turing.io/) Module 2 curriculum. While the theme of the shop is rather specific, it implements both tags and categories (the charities) to classify items and offers an admin functionality to view and sort orders and create new items.

##Development
This project utilizes Ruby on Rails as a web app framework, [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for file attachment & storage, and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for styling.
